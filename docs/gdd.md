## **Towers**

* There are level 1 towers (or base towers) and level 2 towers (or upgraded towers). A level 2 tower can only be built on a base tower.
* Towers fire at enemies within range. They do not spawn troops; they only fire at target.
* Armor piercing represents the percentage of armor ignored when the damage is applied: for example, an armor piercing value of 20% applied to an armor of 10 means that, for purposes of damage calculation, the armor value is only 8.
* There are three types of towers: Bunker, Missile and Sniper Tower.
