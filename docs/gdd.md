* Armor piercing_ represents the percentage of armor ignored when the damage is applied: for example, an armor piercing value of 20% applied to an armor of 10 means that, for purposes of damage calculation, the armor value is only 8.
* There are three type of tower: Bunker, Missile and Sniper Tower.
